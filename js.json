It&#8217;s advice I try to live by every day.</p>\n<p>We do an enormous amount of research with you, our readers, and you have repeatedly told us that the Must List is your second-favorite section of the magazine. (The first? Marc Snetiker&#8217;s Bullseye.) So starting with this issue, we&#8217;re putting our Must List on steroids. The gist is still the same — each week you&#8217;ll get a look at the 10 shows, movies, songs, books, etc., that we&#8217;re most psyched about. But in addition, you&#8217;ll see Q&amp;A&#8217;s with the stars of those projects, mini binge guides, episode synopses, streaming recommendations, and a whole bunch more candy. (Sidebar: Speaking of candy, has anyone tried the new caramel M&amp;M&#8217;s? I haven&#8217;t, but am intrigued.) Meanwhile, News &amp; Notes has been replaced by a series of news stories that will keep you abreast of pop culture&#8217;s biggest events, issues, and trends. You&#8217;ll also find plenty of news nuggets and sidebars in the review sections.</p>\n<p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"http://ew.com/news/must-list-narcos-fifth-harmony-good-time/narcos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">See What Made This Week&#8217;s Must List</a></strong></p>\n<p>The Must List&#8217;s terrific new design is the handiwork of the wise (and handsome and brilliant) gentlemen you see below: EW&#8217;s creative director Tim Leong and design director Keir Novesky.

Thanks to your enthusiasm, we have put the show on the cover twice since then — and you&#8217;ve made those issues some of our best sellers in recent years. As season 3 of Starz&#8217;s drama approached, we sent editor at large Lynette Rice (also wise, beautiful, and brilliant) to the <em>Outlander</em> set in South Africa to bring you exclusive scoop on the new season — especially Jamie and Claire&#8217;s long-awaited reunion. She delivers an excellent story (find all the online highlights <a href=\"http://ew.com/outlander/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>) and will be sharing intel with you throughout the fall both online and on her weekly show, <em>Outlander Live</em>, on EW Radio (SiriusXM 105).</p>\n<p>To celebrate your devotion, we have produced <a href=\"http://ew.com/tv/2017/08/24/outlander-season-3-ew-cover/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">three collector&#8217;s covers</a> this week.

    "html": "<p>Jenny Boeth — pictured above with her son, Sam Whipple — passed away hours before the solar eclipse at the age of 63 after a long battle with cancer. And like the celestial event, she was a once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon. As EW&#8217;s deputy chief of reporters, her job was to make sure the magazine was error-free and to keep us accountable to you. Fact-checking is by far some of the most difficult work in journalism. It involves &#8220;re-reporting&#8221; a story, and oftentimes an article&#8217;s writer isn&#8217;t too pleased to be proved incorrect. But Jenny quickly won the respect and love of everyone on staff after she started in 1999. She was upbeat, kind, incredibly smart, and tenacious — she fought cancer like no one I&#8217;ve ever seen, insisting on working almost till the day she died. Jenny toiled behind the scenes to make sure everyone else shined, and all the journalists who have worked with her during her tenure owe her an enormous debt of gratitude. (Below, you&#8217;ll find some tributes from her colleagues.) We will miss her like hell and are incredibly grateful for her life. — Henry Goldblatt</p>\n<p>Jenny was tireless and meticulous, warm and generous. And if she were here right now fact-checking this page, she&#8217;d find at least three pesky mistakes that no one else caught, and then go home and stay up worrying that she&#8217;d somehow missed another one. You caught &#8217;em all, Jenny. Sleep tight. — Dan Snierson</p>\n<p>I would guess Jenny stopped me looking like an idiot in print a million times. That number seems right to me and is also one I&#8217;m giving in the hope she will somehow steal up by my shoulder and politely suggest I shouldn&#8217;t be &#8220;guessing&#8221; about figures like that. — Clark Collis</p>\n<p>She was the most passionate seeker of absolute truth of anyone I — or anyone at EW — have ever known. That made her a superb researcher. What made her a superb woman was something else: a wicked and reliable sense of humor, an unerring interest in the happiness and emotional health of her co-workers, a laugh you couldn&#8217;t hear and not join. — Sean Smith</p>\n<p>Thank you, &#8220;big sister&#8221; and strong NYC girl, for your friendship and invaluable guidance, and for making a positive impact on the world in so many ways. — Sabrina McFarland</p>\n<p>On the nights that we put an issue to bed, it can go very late. With Jenny, there were no cutoffs. Often you&#8217;d get home at 2 a.m. and there&#8217;d be an apologetic message waiting: &#8220;Are we 100 percent positive of this?&#8221; Sometimes it was maddening. Usually it was hilarious. She couldn&#8217;t sleep until she was sure she&#8217;d nailed down every last fact. She never asked for thanks, but she made every writer look better than they are. So, belatedly, thank you, Jenny. — Chris Nashawaty</p>\n<p>Jenny never had a byline, but if you&#8217;re a fan of <em>Lost</em> or <em>The Walking Dead</em> or <em>Game of Thrones </em>— or any other big TV show from the past decade — then you&#8217;ve read Jenny&#8217;s work. However, as much as she meant professionally, she meant even more as a friend. I&#8217;ll miss those late nights laughing with her about pop culture minutiae and geeking out on our favorite fan theories. But I&#8217;ll never forget them. — Dalton Ross</p>\n<p>She made everything I wrote better, including almost every feature on our shared passion, <em>Lost</em>. Her care for our work was matched by her care for her colleagues. She was a huge support to me and my family during my wife&#8217;s fight with cancer, and it pains me that we&#8217;ve now lost Jenny to this vile robber, too. — Jeff Jensen</p>\n<p>We argued constantly. Wait, let me rephrase that: I complained steadily and she just listened. I can’t imagine that Jenny routinely woke up and said, &#8220;Fact-checking Lynette’s stories is the true highlight of my day.” But Jenny — the blithe, scrupulous, chummy ‘ol girl on the other end of the phone — ended up being the highlight of mine. She asked about my kids. We talked about hers. We bitched about our age. She bemoaned her health. And then we got back to business: me complaining, her listening. I loved that broad. — Lynette Rice</p>\n",
